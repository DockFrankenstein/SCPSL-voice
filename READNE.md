# Overview

This application allows you to control SCP: Secret Laboratory using voice commands. It supports custom commands and bind remapping.

# Setup

Download the newest avaliable version [here](/releases) and unpack it. After launching the app it will begin the setup process.

After a while it will say `[Key Serializer] No keybinds detected. Do you want to use the default keybinds?`. If you are using the default keybinds in SL you can press `Y`. If not, press `N` to rebind. You can do this later by executing command `binds_menu`. More about rebinding [here](#rebinding-buttons).

Once the app finishes setup it will say "Ready". From here, you can start speech recognition by executing command `start`.

# Rebinding buttons

Firstly, enter the binds menu by running the `binds_menu` command. In there you have 4 options: `display key list`, `rebind specific key`, `rebind all keys` and `exit`.

If you only have a couple of keys to rebind, press `B`. You will have to specify the key that you want to rebind. If you don't know the name, you can print the list of all binds by pressing `L` in the binds menu.

In case that you want to rebind every key, press `A`.

# Known issues

* Cannot press the middle mouse button. You will have to rebind your inputs in SL to cock a gun.
